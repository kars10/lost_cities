A virtual version of the card game "Lost Cities".
An experiment in testing strategies and probabalistic analysis.

Instructions:
To use:  Open the terminal and navigate to the lost_cities folder
To play against computer (AI): python play_computer.py
To make the computers play: python comp_v_comp.py
comp_v_comp.py allows the user to select play/draw strategies for two AIs and then simulate n games against each other.


The main structures needed for playing the game are found in lost_cities.py.  In that file, there is a card class and a board class.  The game_board class contains everything needed for playing the game.  There are also several functions (play_game and computer_turn) which automate a computer vs computer game as well as single turns for the AI.  

The strategy.py file contains strategies for AIs to play the game.  There is currently only one strategy available for playing/drawing, though a second strategy is being developed in one of the branches.  The comments in this file are more extensive and are intended to allow for additional strategies to be added.
